      As a Full Stack Developer, I bring a unique blend of experiences from my previous roles in the maritime industry and as a Mandarin teacher & translator. I was previously an Educational Mentor at Microverse, a remote software development organization, where I've completed over 40 real-life projects, mastering both front-end and back-end technologies.<br /><br />

        During the course of this journey, I had the privilege to meet 300+ Full Stack Developers, investing over 1300 hours on mastering data structures and algorithms. What's more, I built a community of 150+ fellow Full Stack Developers which I am currently administering. I also mentored a small team of 5 junior developers. 🚀💡👥<br /><br />

        In my latest capstone project, I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive web interface for a logistics firm. Both front-end and back-end, showcasing my proficiency in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL. Combining my passion for languages with my love for coding, I crafted a seamless user experience that I'm truly proud of.
